        <h3>CNC LASER CUTING MACHINES</h3>
        <p>
          CNC (Computer Numerical Control) laser technology is one of the most
          advanced technologies in modern manufacturing. It relies on using
          laser beams for cutting, engraving, and marking various materials,
          allowing for high precision and intricate details.
        </p>

        <h3>How CNC Laser Works</h3>

        <p>
          CNC laser machines operate by directing a focused laser beam onto the
          material to be processed. The movement of the laser is controlled by a
          computer, which precisely dictates the points the laser should target
          based on the desired design. Special design software is used to
          prepare the files containing the necessary instructions for the CNC
          laser machine.
        </p>

        <h3>Components of a CNC Laser Machine</h3>
        <p>
          Laser Source: Generates the laser beam used in various operations.
        </p>
        <p>
          Optical System: Includes lenses and mirrors that guide and focus the
          laser beam.
        </p>
        <p>
          Work Platform: The surface on which the material to be processed is
          placed.
        </p>
        <p>
          Control Unit: The computer and software that control the movement of
          the laser and processing settings.
